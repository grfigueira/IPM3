### Description 

**FEAST** is an app that aims to solve all the problems related to the searching and sharing of recipes for users of all skill levels in what comes to cooking experience.

Great importance is given to the filtering in the search of recipes with customization of the user's experience with features that want to take special attention to allergies, intolerances, and availability of ingredients.
